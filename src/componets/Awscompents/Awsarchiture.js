            Every application needs a place to store data from users, devices, and the application itself.

Providing recommendations for improving your workload based on best practices

Guiding you in making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective

You can use AWS WA Tool to document and measure your workload using the best practices from the AWS Well-Architected Framework. These best practices were developed by AWS Solutions Architects based on their years of experience building solutions across a wide variety of businesses. The framework provides a consistent approach for measuring architectures and provides guidance for implementing designs that scale with your needs over time.

In addition to AWS best practices, you can use custom lenses to measure your workload using your own best practices. You can tailor the questions in a custom lens to be specific to a particular technology or to help you meet the governance needs within your organization. Custom lenses extend the guidance provided by the AWS lenses.
